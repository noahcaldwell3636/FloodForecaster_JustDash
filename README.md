# FloodForecaster_JustDash

This application parses xml data provided by NOAA.gov to provide live updates of the James River's flood data, including forecasted water levels. The application uses climacell which has been changed to tomorrow.io as part of a rebranding. Therefore, much of the functionality is no longer working.
